\section{Question 3.7}

\subsection{Question}
Write a program that can create a valid sitemap based on the contents of a directory on your computer's hard disk. Assume that the files are accessible from a website at the URL http://www.example.com. For instance, if there is a file in your directory called homework.pdf, this would be available at http://www.example.com/homework.pdf. Use the real modification date on the file as the last modified time in the sitemap, and to help estimate the change frequency.

\subsection{Resources}
With the Python programming language \cite{python}, the script {\ttfamily sitemapgen.py} was created to perform the necessary tasks to complete this question.  This script can be found in Listing \ref{listing:sitemapgen}.  The output matches the format found at Sitemaps.org \cite{sitemaps}.

The script uses the last modified time of each file to estimate the change frequency and also escapes special characters in the output to ensure valid output.  The DOM is built while the script traverses the file system and when this process is complete the document is printed to standard out.

\subsection{Answer}
Starting with with the folder structure found in Listing \ref{listing:tree} as input script produced the output shown in Listing \ref{listing:sitemapout}.

\lstinputlisting[language=bash, caption={test directory structure}, label=listing:tree]{q3.7/tree}

\lstinputlisting[language=bash, caption={site map generator output}, label=listing:sitemapout]{code/smgen/output}
