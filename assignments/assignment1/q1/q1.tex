\section{Question 1.1}

\subsection{Question}

Think up and write down a small number of queries for a web search engine.
Make sure that the queries vary in length (i.e., they are not all one word). Try
to specify exactly what information you are looking for in some of the queries.
Run these queries on two commercial web search engines and compare the top
10 results for each query by doing relevance judgments. Write a report that an-
swers at least the following questions: What is the precision of the results? What
is the overlap between the results for the two search engines? Is one search engine
clearly better than the other? If so, by how much? How do short queries perform
compared to long queries?

\subsection{Resources}
The search engines Google \cite{google} and DuckDuckGo \cite{duckduckgo} were used to obtain the results.\\

The following search queries were issued to each:

\begin{enumerate}
	\item professional skateboarder
	\item skateboarder
	\item skateboarder from korea
	\item skateboarder from south korea
	\item korean skateboarder thrasher
	\item skateboarder song
	\item daewon song
\end{enumerate}

The expected relevant pages will contain information regarding the professional skateboarder named Daewon Song.
