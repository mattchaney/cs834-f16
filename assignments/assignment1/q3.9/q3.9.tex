\section{Question 3.9}

\subsection{Question}
Write a simple single-threaded web crawler. Starting from a single input URL (perhaps a professor's web page), the crawler should download a page and then wait at least five seconds before downloading the next page. Your program should find other pages to crawl by parsing link tags found in previously crawled documents.


\subsection{Resources}
The {\ttfamily crawler.py} script, found in Listing \ref{listing:crawler}, was written to accomplish this task.  It was written in the Python programming language \cite{python}.  The Requests \cite{py:requests} and BeautifulSoup \cite{py:beautifulsoup} modules were particularly useful in completing this task.  Some sample output can be found in Listing \ref{listing:crawlerout}.


\subsection{Answer}

\lstinputlisting[language=bash, caption={crawler.py output}, label=listing:crawlerout]{code/crawler/output}
