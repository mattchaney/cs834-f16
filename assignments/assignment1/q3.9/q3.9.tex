\section{Question 3.9}

\subsection{Question}
Write a simple single-threaded web crawler. Starting from a single input URL (perhaps a professor's web page), the crawler should download a page and then wait at least five seconds before downloading the next page. Your program should find other pages to crawl by parsing link tags found in previously crawled documents.


\subsection{Resources}
The Python programming language \cite{python} was used to write the script {\ttfamily crawler.py} in Listing \ref{listing:crawler} to crawl the web.  Some sample output can be found in Listing \ref{listing:crawlerout}.


\subsection{Answer}

\lstinputlisting[language=bash, caption={crawler.py output}, label=listing:crawlerout]{code/crawler/output}
