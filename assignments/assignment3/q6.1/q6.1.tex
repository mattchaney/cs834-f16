\section{Question 6.1}

\subsection{Question}
Using the Wikipedia collection provided at the book website, create a sample
of stem clusters by the following process:
\begin{enumerate}
    \item Index the collection without stemming.
    \item Identify the first 1,000 words (in alphabetical order) in the index.
    \item Create stem classes by stemming these 1,000 words and recording which words become the same stem.
    \item Compute association measures (Dice's coefficient) between all pairs of stems in each stem class. Compute co-occurrence at the document level.
    \item Create stem clusters by thresholding the association measure. All terms that are still connected to each other form the clusters.
\end{enumerate}

Compare the stem clusters to the stem classes in terms of size and the quality (in
your opinion) of the groupings.

\subsection{Approach}
The \texttt{stem.py} and \texttt{cluster.py} scripts, found in Listings \ref{listing:stem} and \ref{listing:cluster}, were used to define the initial stem classes from the list of 1,000 words.  This list was created using words from a previously constructed inverted index in the small Wikipedia collection.

After the stem classes were compiled, Dice's coefficient was calculated for all pairs of terms within each class, and then pairs of co-occurring stemmed words that had a resulting score below a threshold of 0.1 were dropped from their class, resulting in a tight cluster of co-occurring terms.  

\subsubsection{Initial Classes}
The first 1,000 words stemmed by using the nltk SnowballStemmer \cite{py:nltk} resulted in the following stem classes:\\

addict: Addiction, Addict\\


\subsubsection{Stem Clusters}
With a Dice's coefficient threshold value of 0.1 applied to filter out the weakly-linked stem class elements, the following are the remaining stem clusters:\\

\noindent
ah: Ahli, Ahly\\
adolesc: Adolescents, Adolescence\\
adopt: Adopt, Adoption\\
agua: Aguas, Agua\\
agricultura: Agriculturae, Agricultura\\
aflah: Aflah, AflaH\\
address: Addressing, Addresses\\
ador: Adoration, Adoring\\
adventur: Adventure, Adventures\\
age: Aging, Ageing\\
agit: Agitators, Agitator, Agitation\\


\subsection{Results}
It seems clear that applying a co-occurrence association measure to the stem class creation process reduces the number of classes created overall, even breaking apart some groups that are logically similar.  For example, the \textit{addict} class featured the two words Addiction and Addict.  One being a different capitalization of the root stem and the other being a modified form of the stem, which shows that the class could have remained together, but this method dropped them from the initial stem classes.

This observation casts some doubt on the usage of a Dice's coefficient threshold of 0.1 to create semantically related stem classes.  There are other examples of related word groups being broken apart by the coarseness of this threshold.  To test the tuning of this parameter, another test run was conducted with a value of 0.00001 for the threshold.  This experimental run produced the following stem clusters:\\


\noindent
affair: Affair, Affairs\\
ah: Ahli, Ahly\\
agricultura: Agriculturae, Agricultura\\
agenc: Agency, Agencies\\
agit: Agitators, Agitator, Agitation\\
affili: Affiliation, Affiliate, Affiliates, Affiliations\\
adventur: Adventurers, Adventures, Adventure\\
agricultur: Agricultural, Agriculture\\
advoc: Advocate, Advocates\\
aflah: Aflah, AflaH\\
advanc: Advance, Advanced\\
agreement: Agreements, Agreement\\
agua: Aguas, Agua\\
adult: Adults, Adult\\
address: Addressing, Addresses, Address\\
ador: Adoration, Adoring\\
afghan: Afghan, Afghans\\
addit: Addition, Additionally, Additive, Additional, Additives\\
administr: Administrator, Administratively, Administration, Administrators, Administrations, Administrative\\
adolesc: Adolescents, Adolescence\\
adopt: Adopt, Adoption\\
admir: Admirals, Admiral\\
african: Africans, Africanism, African\\
age: Aging, Age, Ages, Ageing\\
aesthet: Aesthetics, Aesthetic\\

These also seem to show good grouping for the stem classes but there are still a significant number of classes that were broken up that reasonably could have been kept together in a single cluster.  Upon inspecting the data at run time, it appears that some of the terms that were put into stem classes together do not actually co-occur within any documents at all, even though they are semantically linked to the same root word, which explains why they were separated as part of the Dice's coefficient threshold filtering operation.  Future use of association measures such as this should take this and other related corpus-specific phenomena into account when attempting to perform this type of contextual analysis.
