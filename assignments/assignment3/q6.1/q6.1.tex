\section{Question 6.1}

\subsection{Question}
Using the Wikipedia collection provided at the book website, create a sample
of stem clusters by the following process:
\begin{enumerate}
    \item Index the collection without stemming.
    \item Identify the first 1,000 words (in alphabetical order) in the index.
    \item Create stem classes by stemming these 1,000 words and recording which words become the same stem.
    \item Compute association measures (Dice's coefficient) between all pairs of stems in each stem class. Compute co-occurrence at the document level.
    \item Create stem clusters by thresholding the association measure. All terms that are still connected to each other form the clusters.
\end{enumerate}

Compare the stem clusters to the stem classes in terms of size and the quality (in
your opinion) of the groupings.

\subsection{Approach}
The \texttt{stem.py} script, found in Listing \ref{listing:stem}, was used to solve this problem.
