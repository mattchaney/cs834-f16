\subsection{Question}
Using the small Wikipedia example, choose 10 words and create stem classes as per the algorithm on pp. 191-192.

\begin{enumerate}
    \item For all pairs of words in the stem classes, count how often they co-occur in text windows of W words. W is typically in the range 50-100.
    \item Compute a co-occurrence or association metric for each pair. This measures how strong the association is between the words.
    \item Construct a graph where the vertices represent words and the edges are between words whose co-occurrence metric is above a threshold T .
    \item Find the connected components of this graph. These are the new stem classes.
\end{enumerate}
