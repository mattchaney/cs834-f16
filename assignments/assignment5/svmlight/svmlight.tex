\section{SVM Light Example}

\subsection{Inductive Example}
SVM Light \cite{svmlight} and the Inductive example were downloaded from \url{http://www.cs.cornell.edu/People/tj/svm_light/}.\\

Following the instructions in the Inductive example, the \texttt{svm\_learn} program was invoked on the training data file train.dat, the output from which can be found in Listing \ref{listing:svmlearn}.  This produced the model file that is used in the classification step.

After the model file was generated the example directs the user to run the \texttt{svm\_classify} program on the provided test data \texttt{(filename: test.dat)} using the training model \texttt{(filename: model)} from the previous step.  The output of this can be found in Listing \ref{listing:svmclass}.

\subsection{Discussion}
As the results show, the precision was 96.67\% and the recall was 99.00\%, which are very high scores for these measures.
