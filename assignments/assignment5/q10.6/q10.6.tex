\section{Question 10.6}

\subsection{Question}
Find two examples of document filtering systems on the Web. How do they build a profile for your information need? Is the system static or adaptive?

\subsection{Answer}
The first example I found was \url{www.amazon.com}.  This is an Internet marketplace where nearly any type of product can be purchased online and delivered to one's home.  The document filtering Amazon performs is done in an adaptive manner using a combination of the user data from previous purchases to recommend new items the user may be interested in.  The system can also recommend items that similar users often purchase that are also similar to items the user is viewing while browsing the item repository.  For example, if one purchases a mechanical pencil it is likely that the user will also be interested in purchasing graphite refill packages or extra replacement erasers.  This system changes over time as the database of related items is based on the past purchases of the different items and how some items are more often purchased together than others.
