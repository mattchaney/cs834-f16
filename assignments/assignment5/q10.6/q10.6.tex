\section{Question 10.6}

\subsection{Question}
Find two examples of document filtering systems on the Web. How do they build a profile for your information need? Is the system static or adaptive?

\subsection{Answer}
My first example is Amazon (\url{www.amazon.com}).  This is an Internet marketplace where nearly any type of product can be purchased online and delivered to one's home.  The document filtering Amazon performs is done in an adaptive manner using a combination of the user data from previous purchases to recommend new items the user may be interested in.  The system can also recommend items that are often purchased in conjunction with items the user is viewing while browsing the item repository.  For example, if one purchases a mechanical pencil, it is likely that the user will also be interested in purchasing graphite refills or replacement erasers.  This system changes over time as the database of related items is based on the past purchases of the different items and how some items are more often purchased together than others.

The second example is Netflix (\url{www.netflix.com}).  This is an online video streaming service that famously posted an open challenge for anyone that could provide a better recommendation system than their own implementation and provided a large data set for anyone to use to develop and test their own recommender system.  If any party could create a system that beat their existing system's computed root mean squared error (RMSE).  The team with the highest reduction in error was declared the winner.

The data used for the challenge was over 100 million ratings from 400 thousand users regarding 17 thousand movies.  They came as a quadruplet matching the form:\\

\texttt{<user, movie, date of grade, grade>}\\

The user and movie fields are simple unique identifiers.  The grade is an integer from 1 to 5.  The goal of the recommender system is to predict the rating a user \textit{would} give to a movie they haven't yet watched.  This is a dynamic system as it uses live user data to provide a recommendation of a predicted highly rated movie for each user to watch based on their ratings of previously watched movies.
