\section{Question 10.5}

\subsection{Question}
Find a community-based question answering site on the Web and ask two
questions, one that is low-quality and one that is high-quality. Describe the answer quality of each question.

\subsection{Approach}
Yahoo! Answers is the question and answering website I chose to answer this question.  First, the high quality question I asked was ``How is the probability of precipitation calculated by meteorologists?''.  

I deem this question to be of high quality based on grammaticality, spelling and punctuation, as well as the use of concise terminology that may be slightly obscure to an uneducated reader.

It is also a focused question that has a definite set of answers.  There are a finite number of ways to perform the calculation in question, and they are well known.  The ideal answerer is even included as part of the question.  Refer to Table \ref{tab:goodq} to see some example answers for this question.

For the poor quality question I asked ``Trump is not russia, y u no belief he got hakerz to do it to us?''.  It begins with a premise that doesn't make sense, even the most uneducated person wouldn't suspect that Trump \textit{is} Russia.  It also lacks focus as to what is being asked or and has no real context and is full of misspellings and terrible grammar.  Correspondingly, the answers were lacking content, using poor grammar and exhibiting numerous spelling errors, and some possibly offensive to some readers.  Refer to Table \ref{tab:badq} for the question again with some sample answers.
