\section{Question 8.5}

\subsection{Question}
Generate the mean average precision, recall-precision graph, average NDCG at 5 and 10, and precision at 10 for the entire CACM query set.

\subsection{Approach}
The \texttt{getrel.py} and \texttt{q85.py} scripts were used to complete this question. They can be found in Listings \ref{listing:getrel} and \ref{listing:q85}.

\subsection{Results}

Using only the queries for which relevance judgments exist the mean average precision, NDCG @5 and 10, and the precision @ 10 were calculated.  The results can be found in Table \ref{tab:q85}.
